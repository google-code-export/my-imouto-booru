MyImouto.Booru is a **Moebooru port for PHP and MySQL**.

This booru is based on Yande.re (former Moe|Oreno.Imouto.org): all the logic of the system was taken from there and transcribed from Ruby on Rails to PHP.

MyImouto.Booru is still under development, so some sections and features don't work yet. More info on this in the WhatIsMyImouto wiki page.

However, it can be used online. You can see a live demo here: http://myimouto.pop-works.info/
